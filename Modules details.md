# Mosquitto MQTT broker:

Eclipse Mosquitto is an open-source message broker that implements the MQTT protocol. Mosquitto is lightweight and is suitable for all types of devices, <mark> from low power single board computers to full servers </mark>.

The MQTT protocol provides a lightweight method of carrying out messaging using a publish/subscribe model. This makes it suitable for Internet of Things messaging such as with low power sensors or mobile devices such as phones, embedded computers or microcontrollers.

Here are some key features of Mosquitto:

1. **Lightweight**: It can run on all types of systems, including low-power systems and embedded devices.
2. **Security**: It <mark> supports SSL/TLS for network encryption and authentication </mark>, and can also use pre-shared key (PSK) encryption.
3. **Quality of Service**: MQTT has <mark> three quality of service levels (At most once, At least once, Exactly once) </mark>. Mosquitto supports all of them.
4. **Community and Documentation**: As part of the Eclipse Foundation, Mosquitto has a strong community and good documentation, which makes it easier to get help and find information. MQTT libraries available for a wide variety of programming languages

# Redis database:

Redis (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker. It supports various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets with range queries, bitmaps, hyperloglogs, and geospatial indexes with radius queries.

Here are some key features of Redis:

1. **In-Memory Storage**: Redis stores data in memory (RAM), resulting in <mark> fast read and write operations </mark>.
2. **Persistence**: You <mark> can configure Redis to persist data to the disk, </mark> allowing you to use it as a NoSQL database.
3. **Data Structures**: Redis supports a <mark> wide variety of data structures, </mark> making it versatile for different use cases.

However, other databases also support some of these data structures, but not as extensively as Redis. Here's a brief overview:

1. **SQLite**: Primarily supports tabular data. It <mark> doesn't natively support data structures like lists, sets, or hashes, </mark> but you can emulate some of these using tables.

Berkeley DB, InfluxDB, RocksDB and LevelDB, LMDB also have same issues as SQLite

If an application heavily relies on data structures like lists, sets, hashes, Redis would be a good choice given its native support for these data structures. However, if your embedded system has limited resources, you might need to consider other options or ways to emulate these data structures.
