#User Manual: Resolving Missing Dependencies Error in React App

#Step 1: Check Node.js and npm Versions

Before starting the React application, ensure that you have the correct versions of Node.js and npm installed on your system.

To check the npm version, run the following command:

$ npm -v
To check the Node.js version, run the following command:

$ node -v
Make sure the npm version is 6.14.18 and the Node.js version is v14.21.3. If they match, proceed to the next step.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Step 2: Navigate to React App Directory
Navigate to the directory where your React application is located using the terminal or command prompt.

For example:

  $ cd /home/rajesh/dataharvesting-device/ui_with_react

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Step 3: Check for Node Modules
Once inside the React application directory, check if the node_modules folder is present.

Use the ls command to list all files and folders in the directory:


 $ ls
If you don't see the node_modules folder listed, it means the dependencies are missing.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#Step 4: Install Dependencies
To install the dependencies required for your React application, run the following command:


 $ npm install
Wait for npm to download and install all the dependencies listed in the package.json file. This will create the node_modules folder in your project directory.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Step 5: Verify Installation
After the installation process is complete, verify that the node_modules folder has been created by listing the directory contents again:


 $ ls
You should now see the node_modules folder listed among the files and folders.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#Step 6: Start the React Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can start your React application using the following command:


 $ npm start
This command will start the development server and automatically open your React application in the default web browser.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the missing dependencies error and successfully start your React application. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask for help.
